'fb-pages-company_Data_Files': This is the folder containing the data files downloaded from
networkrepository. The two files located in this folder are 'fb-pages-company.edges' and
'fb-pages-company.nodes', which are used in the 'CS176_Project_Code.ipynb' notebook.

'CS176_Project_Code.ipynb': This is the Google Colab notebook which contains the project
code used to preprocess the dataset and obtain information about the network, degree
distribution, centralities, and clustering coefficients. In order for it to run, it must have the path to
the 'fb-pages-company.edges' and 'fb-pages-company.nodes' files. Sections of the notebook,
such as the Closeness and Betweenness Centralities, may take some time to run due to the
amount of nodes in the network.

'Data': This is the folder containing the data files used in the Neo4j visualizations.
The two files located in this folder are 'fb-pages-company_nodes.csv' and
'fb-pages-company.edges.csv'.

'Neo4j_Project_Code.pdf': This is the code documentation for loading in the csv files to Neo4j,
creating the Neo4j visualizations (such as K-nearest nodes, shortest paths, etc.) and creating
the case study.
